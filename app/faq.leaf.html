<h1>htmlbin FAQ</h1>

<h2>How do I use images?</h2>

Either get them hosted elsewhere - or, if the images are less than 32K,
embed them with a data URI using base64 encoding.

<h2>How do I edit a page that is already hosted?</h2>

Make a new one! You may do this as many times as you like. If you want to have
a persistent URL, use web forwarding with your domain.

<h2>How long will my page be hosted?</h2>

Until it is classed as inactive - no visits for a long time.

<h2>How do I delete a page?</h2>

You don't need to - inactive pages are deleted.

<h2>Will my page be ad-free?</h2>

Yes!

<h2>Will my page be indexed by search engines?</h2>

Only if you link to it from other sites. Bots cannot crawl htmlbin pages.
